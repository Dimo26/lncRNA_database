# Database design and programming for analysis of non-coding RNA in relation to disease causing genes.  

In this project I will be creating a database combining information about lncRNA and the adjacent genes of which are related to diseases. The pupose is to collect all this information in one place for easier and more flexible access. 

## Functions
The database has been designed to be compatable with Bianca UPPMAX. The database has various applications. It can be used for a double ended search where the user can find ncRNA of which regulates certain genes and vice versa. It is also possible to gain information about regulationtypes such as uppregulation or downregulation.
